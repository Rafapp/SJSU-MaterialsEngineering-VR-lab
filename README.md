## Introduction
CVRLabSJSU allows students to simulate tensile testing of specimen materials, interactive diagrams demonstrating Poisson's ratio, and provides a way to quiz them based on the lab experimentations. This laboratory is being used to research the effects of "embodied cognition" described in Markansky et. al, 2020, through an A/B split test.

## How to run in a Meta Quest 2
1. Download the apk's in this repository. If you wish to use the embodied version of the lab, use `VRlab_A`, otherwise use `VRlab_B`.
2. Sideload the apk to your Meta Quest 2 using a Usb-C cable using a tool such as SideQuest https://sidequestvr.com
3. Run the application. Keep in mind, the current builds will 

## How to edit and build using Unity Engine
1. Clone the repository
2. Open the `VRlab` folder using Unity Desktop. The latest Unity version should work, although the project was developed with `Unity 2022.2.18f1 , macOS Silicon`.
3. Make any customizations as necessary
4. Switch the build to Android, Build and Run with your Oculus Quest 2 headset connected. More information: https://developer.oculus.com/documentation/unity/unity-build/
